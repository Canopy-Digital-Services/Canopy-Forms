# Epic 9 — Editor Hierarchy & Visual Polish Pass

## Goal

Increase perceived product maturity without increasing visual noise.

## Problem

The editor currently feels flat and "internal" due to uniform card styling and minimal hierarchy.

## Scope

* Add subtle page background tint.
* Differentiate primary (Fields) and secondary sections using elevation/shadow.
* Add micro-descriptions under section headers.
* Improve hover states for field rows.
* Increase vertical spacing and padding for better rhythm.
* Ensure consistent typography scale.

## Acceptance Criteria

* "Fields" reads as primary workspace.
* Secondary sections feel visually subordinate.
* No net increase in UI clutter.
