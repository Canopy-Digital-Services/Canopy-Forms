# Epic 8 — Reorganize "After Submission" into "Submission Settings"

## Goal

Improve information architecture and reduce cognitive load as the settings surface grows.

## Problem

The current "After Submission" panel mixes behavior, notifications, security, and limits into a single block.

## Scope

* Rename "After Submission" → "Submission Settings" (or "Behavior").
* Inside the expanded panel, split into sub-sections:

  1. After Submission (Message / Redirect)
  2. Notifications (multi-recipient email UI)
  3. Access & Limits (Allowed Origins + Limits)
* Add short helper descriptions under each subsection header.
* Add collapsed summary metadata (e.g., "2 emails configured · Redirect enabled").

## Acceptance Criteria

* Notifications are visually separated from redirect logic.
* Users can locate settings without scanning unrelated content.
* Collapsed section shows concise status summary.
